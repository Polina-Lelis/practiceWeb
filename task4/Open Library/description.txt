The API allows requesting information on one or more books using ISBNs, 
OCLC Numbers, LCCNs and OLIDs (Open Library IDs).
The API supports the following query parameters.
bibkeys:List of IDs to request the information. The API supports ISBNs, LCCNs, OCLC numbers and OLIDs (Open Library IDs).

The Data Format:

bib_key-Identifier used to query this book.

info_url-A URL to the book page in the Open Library.

preview-Preview state - either "noview" or "full".

preview_url-A URL to the preview of the book.

This links to the archive.org page when a readable version of the book is available, otherwise it links to the book page on openlibrary.org.

thumbnail_url-A URL to a thumbnail of the cover of the book. This is provided only when thumbnail is available.

In request1 i'd like to find all books using keys such as "author" and "title".
And after that i get the list of all possible books with this title and author.

In request2 and request3 i'd like to find 2 books using only 2 parameters:format and bebkeys(ISBN, LCCN).
And i get bib_key, preview, preview_url, info_url.
